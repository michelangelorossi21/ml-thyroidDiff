# ðŸ“Œ Thyroid Cancer Recurrence Prediction (Machine Learning)
## ðŸ“Œ Description
This machine learning project predicts the possible recurrence of thyroid cancer using a dataset of medical records. The model is trained to classify patients based on factors such as age, gender, and various clinical indicators, helping doctors to better anticipate the likelihood of cancer recurrence.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Python
scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
NumPy (for numerical computations)
Matplotlib (for visualizations)

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
```sh
   git clone https://github.com/michelagelorossi21/iot-concert-enviroment.git
   cd IoT-Simulator

2. Run the model:
```sh
   git clone https://github.com/michelagelorossi21/iot-concert-enviroment.git
   cd IoT-Simulator

## ðŸ”¹ Key Features
- Data preprocessing using pandas for cleaning and preparing the dataset
- Feature selection to identify the most important variables for prediction
- Model training and evaluation using scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-nearest neighbours, Linear SVC)
- Cross-validation for improved accuracy of the model
- Visualizations of results and model performance
